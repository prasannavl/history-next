v2.1:

= removed: utils from the default export. Utils can be used by explicity importing from "lib/utils"
v2.0.10-11:
- deps: remove core-js. Configure to use ts libs instead.
v2.0.8:
- tools: remove typings and switch to the native support starting from typescript 2
- deps: update all dependencies
v2.0.7:
- Fix: BrowserHistory: Pass the whole url, not just the path name 
v2.0.2:
- Fix: Add better dispose semantics, with removing listeners and full cleanup
v2.0.0: 
- Major breaking changes.
- No longer provides a view of the context, as it first conceived. Handling the
contextual layers in the application is far simpler, and more easily reasoned with.
- The API has been simplified (due to the above), and Listeners now are directly of type
 HistoryListenerDelegate, and so it simply returns a promise. There's no longer
 a need to call `next(context)`.
- However, the context API is kept the same, for now.
- IHistory.context has been renamed to IHistory.current
v1.2:
- added: IHistory: previous context.
- change: rename `frontline` parameter to align with DOM idiomatic `capture`.
v1.1.3:
- fix (critical): BrowserHistory: this.context wasn't updated.
v1.1.2:
- add: BrowserHistory: createContextFromPath 
v1.1.1:
- fix: correct changelog
v1.1.0:
- add: BrowserHistory: createNormalizedContext
- add: HistoryContext: createNormalizedFromPath
- add: utils: tools for trimming, and cleaning url slashes (used by normalized versions above)
v1.0.15: 
- change: BrowserHistory: switch HistoryCore's context along with pop state
v1.0.14:
- fix: HistoryCore: Major bug in onBeforeChange listeners: Listener array was reversed accidentally 
- fix: BrowserHistory: Change listeners were passed the same context during popstate
